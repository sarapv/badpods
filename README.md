# BAD-PODS

This repository contains the implementation of **BAD-PODS** (Bayesian Adaptive Design for Partially Observable Dynamical Systems).  

The code provides:
- Estimators of the expected information gain (EIG) and its gradient.  
- An online framework based on nested particle filters (NPFs).  
- Example experiments: two-group SIR model and moving source location.
